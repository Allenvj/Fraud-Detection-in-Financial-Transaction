# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

This project implements a **Fraud Detection system** using machine learning techniques (Random Forest) to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Handling imbalanced dataset using SMOTE
- Random Forest classifier for fraud detection
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **not included** in the repository due to its large size (~470 MB). You can download it here:
